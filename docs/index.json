Depending on your background, it may be unlike any other kind of writing you have done. Below is the standard formatting for a memo assignments in this course (and in PSPA 610).\nIn addition to this formatting, I require a short executive summary (1 paragraph) outlining your recommendation and reasoning (on the first page). The logic is that a decision-maker can quickly read what you are recommending and why they should take that course of action. If they need further background or analysis, that\u0026rsquo;s in the full memo.\nThe department is in the process of adopting a memo writing standard and format. To maintain consistency with PSPA 610, I have included Dr. Thurmaier\u0026rsquo;s memo format. Please abide by this formatting at all times or you will lose points.\nLinks for memo resources  Guide to Writing an Effective Policy Memo Policy Memos Writing Effective Policy Memos  Revenue analysis At the end of the course, you will demonstrate your knowledge of revenue analysis by completing a final project.\nComplete details for the final project are here.\nThere is no final exam.

Indeed, no universal revenue structure is discernible within a particular class of governments. The design and administration of an appropriate revenue structure for a governmental unit is a function of the relevant economic and political environment within which the unit is operating, including the legal foundation for the unit’s powers.\nIn consultation with your instructor, choose a unit of local government in Illinois for analysis. Your paper will be an in-depth analysis of the revenue structure and revenue policy of this government. Normally, this analysis will require consideration of both the unit’s Comprehensive Annual Financial Report and the unit’s annual budget(s) (operating and capital budgets are both instructive) At minimum, your paper must discuss the following issues:\n Legal foundations of this type of governmental unit in Illinois. From where does this governmental unit derive its authority? Is the government subject to Dillon’s Rule? General powers and duties of this type of governmental unit. What are the responsibilities of this type of governmental unit? General history of the chosen unit. Political environment surrounding the unit and its operations. Where does the political power lie in this jurisdiction? How has the political environment shifted over time? Economic environment and its effect on the chosen government. Be sure to discuss the resilience of the local government’s finances and operations in an unstable economy. Description and explanation of the revenue structure of the unit. Critical analysis of the revenue structure of the unit. Prescriptions for improvement in the government’s revenue structure.  Your paper will be graded on its general structure, exposition, grammar, and cohesiveness, as well as its fulfillment of the assignment according to the rubric in this syllabus. Be sure to support your analysis with reasoning and evidence. Be sure to acknowledge your sources in the text and in your bibliography (this includes municipal documents, websites, etc.). Academic dishonesty, including incomplete or inappropriate citation of sources will not be tolerated and will be grounds for penalties up to and including failure of the course or expulsion from the program or the university. It is each student’s responsibility to familiarize themselves with department, college, and university policies regarding academic dishonesty, as all such policies apply to this course.\nYour paper should be a maximum of 20 (twenty) pages in length (~5,000 words) not including bibliography, endnotes, or tables.1 All other normal formatting requirements apply (12pt, Times New Roman font; double-spaced; 1 inch margins on all sides). Please submit either a .doc/.docx or a PDF file on Blackboard.\nResources Absolutely do not hesitate to ask me questions! I’m here to help! This can be a daunting project and asking me a quick clarifying question can solve many headaches down the line.\nSuggested Outline Here’s an outline of what you’ll need to do.\n Introduction Describe the motivation for your analysis, briefly name and describe the local government you will be analyzing, and briedly explain the usefulness of this exercise to your chosen local government. You may also include a roadmap, outlining the sections to come. (≈150 words)\nBackground Information The next four (4) sections roughly map on to points one through five from the assignment outline above. The section is meant to lay the foundation and provide context for your analysis. These four sections should compose 25-30% (or about 1,000 words) of your total paper.\nNote: Many of these items are incredibly intertwined. Separate treatment of these items is not required and in some instances may not be appropriate.\nLegal Foundations Exxplain the legal foundations of your local government. Does it have home rule or no? What does the answer to this question mean for the powers that can be accessed by your local government? This section is meant to lay out the boundaries of what your local government can and cannot do. (≈250 words)\nHistory Briefly explain the history of your local government. Is it an older village that’s grown slowly or a new boomtown? Again, you’re providing context to your analysis here. (≈250 words)\nResponsibilities What services and other obligations does your local government have? Are they taking full advantage of their home rule powers, if applicable? Again, context. The answers here will likely inform some of the revenue structure. (≈250 words)\nPolitical \u0026amp; Economic Environment What does the local politics look like? Stable? Highly contested? How’s the economy? Growing? Or unstable? (≈250 words)\nOverview of the Revenue Structure How does your local government currently raise revenue? You may find it easier to go revenue-by-revenue here and provide summary sections at the beginning and end. What are the trends? How has the context you’ve provided interacted with these revenues? (≈1,000 words)\nCritical Analysis of the Revenue Structure This section is the meat of your analysis. Combine the background information and overview of the revenue structure to provide a critique of the existing revenue structure. If one were to examine the current revenue structure from the perspective of the three pillars,2 what would they conclude? Is the revenue structure highly efficient or neutral but horribly inequitable? If yes, why might that be? What circumstances led to this situation? (≈1,000 words)\nPolicy Prescriptions \u0026amp; Conclusions Take your critique of your local government’s revenue structure and provide a few recommendations on how they can improve (~2-4 depending on your analysis). These might be large restructurings (you might recommend that one of the few municipalities not levying a property tax begin to do so) or reasonably minor changes (if the overall revenue strucure is fairly strong). Do not feel the need to make sweeping recommendations if they are not appropriate. (≈250-500 words)\n  If you feel you can cover all the topics and make your case in fewer pages, do so. There is no need to unnecessarily fill pages.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n blandoverton2019?\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   ","date":1633564800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1633564800,"objectID":"ebc937fefc16d40c63391d2c85c59397","permalink":"https://pspa635.cgoodman.com/assignment/revenue-analysis/","publishdate":"2021-10-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/assignment/revenue-analysis/","section":"assignment","summary":"A cohesive revenue policy is important to the efficient and effective operation of any governmental unit, yet no single revenue structure is appropriate for all types of government or government enterprises.","tags":null,"title":"Revenue Analysis","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Required Reading Procurement   Chapter 15 in Management Policies in Local Government Finance.1 Posted on Blackboard.  “Public procurement re-examined.”2 Posted on Blackboard.  “Strategic Management in State Government Two Servants of the Same Master: Procurement and Finance”3  “Competition and Federal Contractor Performance.”4  City of Naperville, IL, Purchasing and Bids.

Email me as soon as you decide.\nSlides Download the slides from today’s class.\n    blandoverton2019?\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n fisher2016?\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Kioko-marlowe?\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   ","date":1629331200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1629331200,"objectID":"24bdef858b9ebc83bb0134c283e06cf1","permalink":"https://pspa635.cgoodman.com/content/01-content/","publishdate":"2021-08-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/content/01-content/","section":"content","summary":"Required Readings  The syllabus and assignments pages for this class  Chapters 1 and 2 in A Budgeting Guide for Local Government1  Chapters 1, 2, and 12 in State \u0026amp; Local Public Finance2  James M.","tags":null,"title":"Introduction to Public Finance","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The instructions for this problem set will go live 2 weeks before the deadline.\n","date":1587859200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1587859200,"objectID":"094641ca6493ec65f22772ffe2c4b0ef","permalink":"https://pspa635.cgoodman.com/assignment/03-memo/","publishdate":"2020-04-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/assignment/03-memo/","section":"assignment","summary":"The instructions for this problem set will go live 2 weeks before the deadline.","tags":null,"title":"Memo 3","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" ICMA Finance \u0026amp; Budgeting Resources Government Finance Officers Association Illinois Government Finance Officers Association IL Comptroller Annual Financial Report Search Form Census of Governments  ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"d253a91b29e17d917e16a8c0656ea9df","permalink":"https://pspa635.cgoodman.com/reference/prof-orgs/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/reference/prof-orgs/","section":"reference","summary":" ICMA Finance \u0026amp; Budgeting Resources Government Finance Officers Association Illinois Government Finance Officers Association IL Comptroller Annual Financial Report Search Form Census of Governments  ","tags":null,"title":"Professional and Data Resources","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"  Here’s your roadmap for the semester!\n Content (): This page contains the readings, slides, and recorded lectures for the topic.

Students will be introduced to the economics of and the theoretical basis for government financial activity, as well as the linkages between the expenditure and revenue sides of budgeting and financial administration. A significant portion of the course will be spent investigating various revenue sources available to public sector entities, the economic characteristics of each source, as well as the relative advantages and disadvantages of the various revenue sources under different economic and political conditions. Principles of financial accounting will be learned. Armed with this knowledge, we will also discuss the relationship between public finance and economic development. The remainder of the course will focus on financial administration and on policy discussion based on analytical papers and presentations by members of the class.\n Learning outcomes In order to become effective public leaders, students must develop a solid foundation in technical, analytical, ethical, diversity, accountability, and leadership skills. In addition, students receive greater depth in a specialty area training of their choice: local government management, public management and leadership, fiscal administration, or nonprofit management.\nTo this end the Department of Public Administration uses a competencies based curriculum which establishes specific skills and abilities acquired by the students as they complete the required courses. A portfolio of completed work is displayed by the graduate as evidence of proficiencies in distinct categories of public service. Each course contributes to the competencies based curriculum by focusing on student learning related to some subset of these competencies. Expected mastery of skills in each competency is defined by a hierarchy related to the level of student learning associated with that competency.\nFoundation Knowledge. This level refers to students’ ability to understand and remember specific information and ideas. Foundational knowledge provides the basic understanding that is necessary for other kinds of learning. We expect that students will be at the foundational level early in their development as they are learning on the job and taking introductory courses. For example, students might be able to define cost efficiency or citizen engagement but they have not yet applied those concepts.\nApplication. Beyond foundational, students also learn how to engage in some kind of action; doing something. This is where they start to see their foundational knowledge as useful because they can apply what they are learning. At the application stage, students are still taking a lot of direction on what to do, when, and how. This could be something creative or practical such as writing a memo, creating a budget or learning how to manage more complex projects (but not managing it themselves yet). The student can use the concept of cost efficiency or citizen engagement and correctly apply it to an issue or situation that is the object of the memo.\nIntegration. At this stage, students have specialized knowledge (foundational) and are able to apply that knowledge(application) but they also see and understand the connection between ideas, people or classes and work. This act of making new connections raises their intellectual capacity to the highest stage of learning. Integration also means they are able to successfully manage whole projects and make critical decisions about its design, working independently (under guidance). At this stage, students should be able to bring information from a variety of sources (examples: theory, demographic data, opinions of elected officials, new research etc.) and integrate that information into their work. A student could integrate the concepts of cost efficiency and citizen engagement to address a complex problem or issue and propose creative solutions to a dilemma. Students don’t see themselves as separate from what is happening around them, but see themselves as connected to everyone and everything. It is expected that most students will not reach the integration stage until they are near completion of the program and beyond.\nThis course (PSPA 611) is designed to address the following program competencies:\n  Competency  Assignment  Level      Effectively work with internal and external stakeholders  Memos  F    Use strategic management to facilitate goal identification and execution  Memos, Revenue Analysis  A    Apply decision-making theories to frame and solve public service problems  Memos  A    Conduct environmental scans and identify the windows of opportunity to influence decisions  Memos, Revenue Analysis  A    Evaluate public service issues in terms of effectiveness, efficiency, equity and economy )  Memos, Revenue Analysis  A    Communicate effectively both orally (public speaking) and in writing (analytical and persuasive) for a public service organization and in the public policy process.  Memos, Revenue Analysis, Presentation  A    Develop or adapt policies, programs, goods or services to accommodate changing social demographics for the population they serve.  Revenue Analysis  A/I       Course materials Books We will use two physical textbooks. There are three official textbooks for the class:\n  Nancey Green Leigh and Edward J. Blakely, Planning Local Economic Development: Theory and Practice, 6th ed. (Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE Publications, 2016).   Recommended We will read a few chapters from the below book (the chapters will be on Blackboard). If you are planning on specializing in fiscal administration, you may want to add it to your collection.\n  bartle?   Articles, book chapters, and other materials There will also occasionally be additional articles and videos to read and watch. When this happens, links to these other resources will be included on the reading page for that week.\n  Course policies Communications Course announcements will be made via email so it is imperative that you check your e-mail daily. “I didn’t get the email” is never a valid excuse. The most effect method of communicating with me is using email; however, you are also encouraged to schedule a meeting at my office or a phone call.\n Office hours Please watch this video:\n Office hours are set times dedicated to all of you. This means that I will be in my office (wistfully) waiting for you to come by with whatever questions you have. This is the best and easiest way to find me outside of class and the best chance for discussing class material and concerns. Please come by!\nOutside of regularly scheduled office hours, you can easily make an appointment with me online.\nI understand these topics are likely new and can be scary. Do not suffer in silence! Come talk to me!\n Lauren’s Promise I will listen and believe you if someone is threatening you.\nLauren McCluskey, a 21-year-old honors student athlete, was murdered on October 22, 2018 by a man she briefly dated on the University of Utah campus. We must all take action to ensure that this never happens again.\nIf you are in immediate danger, call 911.\nIf you are experiencing sexual assault, domestic violence, or stalking, please report it to me and I will connect you to resources or call NIU’s Counseling and Consultation Services (815-753-1206).\nAny form of sexual harassment or violence will not be excused or tolerated at Northern. NIU has instituted procedures to respond to violations of these laws and standards, programs aimed at the prevention of such conduct, and intervention on behalf of the victims. NIU Police officers will treat victims of sexual assault, domestic violence, and stalking with respect and dignity. Advocates on campus and in the community can help with victims’ physical and emotional health, reporting options, and academic concerns.\n Late Assignments All course assignments are due at 11:59pm unless otherwise noted. Course policy is that late work will not be accepted. That said, you should always turn in your work, even if late. Generally, you will receive at least partial credit for late work, depending on the assignment. This is better than receiving a ‘0’ on the assignment. All assignments are due at the beginning of class on the assigned due date, unless otherwise specified. For students who contact the instructor before the assignment deadline regarding extenuating circumstances constituting an emergency, the instructor will consider those circumstances and evaluate whether an accommodation can and should be made based on equity, fairness, and compassion. However, an accommodation should not be considered a matter of right in such circumstances.\n Academic Integrity Good academic work must be based on honesty. The attempt of any student to present as his or her own work that which he or she has not produced is regarded by the faculty and administration as a serious offense. Students are considered to have cheated, for example, if they copy the work of another or use unauthorized notes or other aids during an examination or turn in as their own a paper or an assignment written, in whole or in part, by someone else. Students are guilty of plagiarism, intentional or not, if they copy material from books, magazines, or other sources without identifying and acknowledging those sources or if they paraphrase ideas from such sources without acknowledging them. Students guilty of, or assisting others in, either cheating or plagiarism on an assignment, quiz, or examination may receive a grade of F for the course involved and may be suspended or dismissed from the university.\nA faculty member has original jurisdiction over any instances of academic misconduct that occur in a course which the faculty member is teaching. The student shall be given the opportunity to resolve the matter in meetings with the faculty member and the department chair. If the facts of the incident are not disputed by the student, the faculty member may elect to resolve the matter at that level by levying a sanction no greater than an F for that course. The faculty member shall notify the student in writing whenever such action is taken, and Student Conduct shall receive a copy of the Academic Misconduct Incident Report indicating final disposition of the case, which will be placed in the student’s judicial file. In all matters where the charge of academic misconduct is disputed by the student or if the faculty member feels a sanction greater than an F in the course is appropriate (such as repeated offenses or flagrant violations), the faculty member shall refer the matter to Student Conduct, making use of the Academic Misconduct Incident Report. Additional sanctions greater than an F in a course can be levied only through the system of due process established and overseen by Student Conduct or through the university’s research misconduct procedures noted below. Suspension or dismissal from the university for academic misconduct will result in a notation of that action on the transcript of a graduate-level student.\nThe university has adopted additional policies and procedures for dealing with research misconduct among its students, faculty, and staff. The guidelines, entitled Research Integrity at Northern Illinois University, are available in department offices, in the office of the dean of the Graduate School, and online at www.niu.edu/provost/policies/appm/I2.shtml, and pertain to the intentional commission of any of the following acts: falsification of data, improper assignment of authorship, claiming another person’s work as one’s own, unprofessional manipulation of experiments or of research procedures, misappropriation of research funds. If a graduate student fails to maintain the standards of academic or professional integrity expected in his or her discipline or program, the student’s admission to the program may be terminated on recommendation of the student’s major department. A statement on students’ rights to the products of research is available in department offices, in the office of the dean of the Graduate School, and online at www.niu.edu/provost/policies/appm/I2.shtml.\n Accessibility If you need an accommodation for this class, please contact the Disability Resource Center as soon as possible. The DRC coordinates accommodations for students with disabilities. It is located on the 4th floor of the Health Services Building, and can be reached at 815-753-1303 or drc@niu.edu.\nAlso, please contact me privately as soon as possible so we can discuss your accommodations. Please note that you will not be required to disclose your disability, only your accommodations. The sooner you let me know your needs, the sooner I can assist you in achieving your learning goals in this course.\n Name and Pronoun Statement Class rosters and University data systems are provided to faculty with the student’s legal name and legal gender marker. As an NIU student, you are able to change how your preferred/proper name shows up on class rosters. This option is helpful for various student populations, including but not limited to: students who abbreviate their first name; students who use their middle name; international students; and transgender students. As a faculty member, I am committed to using your proper name and pronouns. We will take time during our first class together to do introductions, at which point you can share with all members of our learning community what name and pronouns you use, as you are comfortable. Additionally, if these change at any point during the semester, please let me know and we can develop a plan to share this information with others in a way that is safe for you. Should you want to update your preferred/proper name, you can do so by looking at the following guidelines and frequently asked questions:\n https://www.niu.edu/regrec/preferred_proper_name/index.shtml https://www.niu.edu/regrec/preferred_proper_name/preferrednamefaq.shtml    Assignments and grades You can find descriptions for all the assignments on the assignments page.\n  Assignment  Points  Percent      Preparation (≈ 15 × 7)  105  16.03%    Memo 1  100  15.27%    Memo 2  100  15.27%    Memo 3  100  15.27%    Presentation  50  7.63%    Revenue analysis  200  30.53%    Total  655  NA        Grade  Range  Grade  Range      A  94–100%  C+  77–79%    A−  90–93%  C  73–76%    B+  87–89%  C−  70–72%    B  83–86%  D  63–66%    B−  80–82%  F  \u0026lt; 60%       Star Wars Once you have read this entire syllabus and the assignments page, please click here and e-mail me a picture of a cute Star Wars character.1 Brownie points if it’s animated.\n  \n  Baby Yoda, Babu Frik, porgs, etc. are all super fair game.↩︎\n   ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"e4d5a4a79239f08c6ad0d7cbf1be756c","permalink":"https://pspa635.cgoodman.com/syllabus/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/syllabus/","section":"","summary":"Course objectives Learning outcomes Course materials  Books Recommended Articles, book chapters, and other materials  Course policies  Communications Office hours Lauren’s Promise Late Assignments Academic Integrity Accessibility Name and Pronoun Statement  Assignments and grades Star Wars   table { display: table; } .","tags":null,"title":"Syllabus","type":"page"}]
